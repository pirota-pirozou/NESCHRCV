## for NES  

This program is in the process of being written.

The final goal is to generate a Famicom(NES) palette from the EDGE palette and spit it out along with the corresponding character pattern for the Famicom(NES). This time, if you judge by the fixed 16x16 dots, it doesn't seem to be too difficult.
